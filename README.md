# flutter_tdd

Test Driven Development example for Flutter.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application that adopts [simple test driven development principles](https://www.seaflux.tech/blogs/Flutter-Test-Driven-Development).

### Testing

Run tests once:
```
flutter test
```

Or set up a watch solution, e.g. watch npm package:
```
npm install -g watch
```

Run tests by watching file changes:

```
watch "flutter test" lib test
```

Write test, then write code.

Happy testing!


## Assets

The `assets` directory houses images, fonts, and any other files you want to
include with your application.

The `assets/images` directory contains [resolution-aware
images](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/assets-and-images#resolution-aware).

## Localization

This project generates localized messages based on arb files found in
the `lib/src/localization` directory.

[Internationalizing Flutter
apps](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization)
